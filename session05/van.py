text = '''In the exercises in Chapter 8 (Strings) we wrote a function that counted the number of occur- rences of a letter in a string. A more general version of this problem is to form a frequency table of the letters in the string, that is, how many times each letter appears.
Such a frequency table might be useful for compressing a text file. Because different letters appear with different frequencies, we can compress a file by using shorter codes for common letters and longer codes for letters that appear less frequently.'''
